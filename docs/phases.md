This repository is delivered in clearly delineated phases to support iterative development and validation.

## Phase 0 — Sanity & Baseline
- Establish repository scaffolding and shared tooling.
- Capture the authoritative LokanOS specification for reference.
- Document contribution, security, and community standards.

## Phase 1 — Core Runtime Bootstrapping
- Stand up the minimal runtime crates and interfaces required by the spec.
- Provide smoke tests and automation for continuous validation.

## Phase 2 — Feature Enablement
- Expand services, devices, and automation logic according to the spec.
- Harden interfaces, add diagnostics, and document workflows.

## Phase 3 — Integration & Release
- Finalize production configurations and release artifacts.
- Complete end-to-end validation, security review, and documentation polish.

Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring a traceable, testable delivery path for LokanOS.
